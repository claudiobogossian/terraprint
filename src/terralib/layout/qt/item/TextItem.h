  His transformation matrix is inverted, that is, the inverse of the matrix of the scene, so its coordinate system is screen (pixel), 
  but its position in the scene remains in millimeters.
  This is also son of AbstractItem, so it can become observer of a model (Observable). "View" part of MVC component.
  This item will only accept "plain text", no "rich texts".
